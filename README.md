KNOWN ISSUES:

Does not work in non-english languages currently, so please switch your language and re save and itll be ready for import until I figure out a fix!

If you notice an item is not there! Let me know! Currently this program skips things when it cannot find a valid item id! So.... let me know what was skipped and ill file a bug report with Jawslouis and get it fixed proper!
