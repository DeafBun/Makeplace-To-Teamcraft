# Makeplace-To-Teamcraft

v0.7

This program is designed to work with the Itch.io version of MakePlace, please go grab it here!
https://jawslouis.itch.io/makeplace

Turn your makeplace .json files into an import link usable by teamcraft!

It works! Yipee!
Handles everything fairly well! Will output all dyes, fixtures, blank walls, both inside and out! A full export!
If you have any complaints/questions/etc, please give me a holler at my tech support discord! https://discord.gg/FBbrgSNftf

Download the .exe: https://github.com/DeafBun/Makeplace-To-Teamcraft/raw/main/Makeplace%20to%20Teamcraft%20Importer.exe

You can also run the .py file in your IDE of choice!
