# Makeplace-To-Teamcraft
Turn your makeplace .json files into an import link usable by teamcraft!

It works! Yipee!
Handles everything fairly well! Will output all dyes, fixtures, blank walls, both inside and out! A full export!
If you have any complaints/questions/etc, please give me a holler at my tech support discord! https://discord.gg/FBbrgSNftf

Download the .exe: https://github.com/DeafBun/Makeplace-To-Teamcraft/raw/main/Makeplace%20to%20Teamcraft%20Importer.exe

GUI soon(tm)
